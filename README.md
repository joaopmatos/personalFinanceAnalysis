# Personal Finance Analysis
Monthly Income Distribution by Scenario and Stress Level: an introductory exploration in Data Analytics with Python

This repository will serve as a worklog for a curious exploration of synthetic personal finance data.
The dataset that I'll be using is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/personal-finance-tracker-dataset).

The aim of this exploration is to try and draw differente conclusions through the available data. Not only that, but explore how different methods of presentation influence the spectator's ease of interpretation, as well as our ability to convery the *intended* message.
